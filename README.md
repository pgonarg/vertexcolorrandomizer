# Blender Vertex Color Script

## Description
This Blender script is designed to color each set of connected vertices (or "islands") in a mesh with a different vertex color. It's useful for distinguishing separate parts of a single mesh object through color coding.

## Features
- Automatically generates vertex colors for each connected component of a mesh.
- Assigns a unique, random color to each set of connected vertices.
- Works with any mesh object in Blender.

## Installation
No additional installation required, just Blender. Tested with Blender 2.9x but should be compatible with other versions.

## Usage
To use this script in Blender:
1. Open Blender and select the mesh object you want to modify.
2. Open the Text Editor window.
3. Paste the script into the Text Editor.
4. Run the script by pressing 'Run Script'.
